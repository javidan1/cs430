a) The ER diagram for the database described in the question statement is shown below:

[Student(sid:integer, sname:string, dob:date, phone:string, city:string)]<-[Rent]->[Article(aid:integer, title:string, author:string, pubyear:integer)]

b) To add the constraint that each student must rent at least one article, we can modify the ER diagram as follows:

[Student(sid:integer, sname:string, dob:date, phone:string, city:string)]<-[1..*]->[Article(aid:integer, title:string, author:string, pubyear:integer)]

This means that each student must rent at least one article, and each article can be rented by multiple students.

c) The db schema for the modified ER diagram is shown below:

Students(sid:integer, sname:string, dob:date, phone:string, city:string)
Articles(aid:integer, title:string, author:string, pubyear:integer)
Rent(sid:integer, aid:integer, FOREIGN KEY(sid) REFERENCES Students(sid), FOREIGN KEY(aid) REFERENCES Articles(aid))
